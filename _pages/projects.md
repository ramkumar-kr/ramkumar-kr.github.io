Apart from my work, I also do a bunch of side projects when I am free.

# [Webextensions](/webextensions)

I develop a lot of webextensions which help me in optimizing my web browsing experience.

# [Yet another new tab page](https://yet-another-new-tab-page.appspot.com/)
A start page which I can use in any browser

# [Todolist](https://todolist-webapp.surge.sh/)
The obligatory frontend project which I did a while ago in React.

# Resume builder

I am currently writing a resume builder in latex which can help me in making modular resumes. The current implementation has a lot of rough edges at this time. I'll be posting a link here once it is polished.
