# Optimizing spend on AWS

A large chunk of the internet today is currently hosted on AWS. However, without proper measures, the cost of running infrastructure on AWS can increase dramatically. Taking on the responsibility of DevOps at my company, (which should ideally be called as DevSecFinOps) I was tasked with bringing down our AWS spend. After 2 months, and a region migration, we brought down the cost of our bill down by 50%. This post will talk about the various steps I took in optimizing the spend on AWS.
