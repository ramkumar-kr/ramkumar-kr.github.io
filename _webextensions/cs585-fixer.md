# CS-585 Fixer

For CSCI-585 students only. Have good looking PDFs when printing the cs585 lectures page.
If you are annoyed by the small images and blank pages when saving the lecture page to PDF, this extension is for you.

## How to Use
After installing the addon, go to any lecture page and click on the printer icon which is automatically displayed to the right of the URL bar (just before the bookmark icon in the URL bar). You will be shown a PDF preview of the page.
