# Close tabs to the left

Just like firefox has a close tabs to the right option, I have an extension which closes tabs to the left of the tab.

# Close tabs to the right

I got extremely annoyed for firefox moving the close tabs to the right option inside another menu. Hence, I created an extension which adds this option back to the top level.
