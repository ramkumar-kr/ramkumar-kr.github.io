# Autofiller

If you are tired of filling the same thing multiple times (For example, linkedin url for job applications), this extension is for you. This extension adds a context menu which fills the text box by clicking on it.

By going to the preferences page, you can edit the menu to add or remove whatever suits you best.

## [Download for Firefox](/xpi/autofiller-1.0.1-fx.xpi)
