I was given the task of writing a few scripts using maxscript to automate some render based tasks.

## Maxscript

Maxscript is a scripting language for 3DS Max. It helps you to automate tasks and provide UI for them. 

## The challenge

One of the scripts I have to write involved in writing a post render script using [Autodesk Backburner](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/troubleshooting/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/Installation-3DSMax/files/GUID-F6732A30-821C-4547-9FAA-E46BCA13392A-htm.html) to save multiple render channels to a path given using user input (choosen using the standard file dialog).
The post render script contained saving all render channels using [`vfbcontrol()`](https://docs.chaosgroup.com/display/VRAY3MAX/Controlling+the+VFB+Programmatically)
However, the method requires the path of the rendered output to be passed as an argument.
The problems are
* The post render script call for backburner requires the absolute path to the script file. 
* There can be multiple renders happening at a point in time.

## The Jugaad

* Write a pre-render script which generates the post render script with the file path (One more level and it will become inception).
* Store the post render script in the same directory as the render output

The jugaad was done to meet some pressing deadlines. If you think there is a better approach, I would be really thankful if you can tell me about it.
